    <h3 class="section">Legal Requirements</h3>
    <p>We accept most submissions. If they turn out to be illegal in some countries we may apply keywords for possible filtering.</p>
    <p>Files should be dedicated to the Public Domain.</p>
    <p><strong>DO NOT</strong> submit any trademarked or copyrighted graphics. These images will not be included in the repository unless explicitly placed into the public domain. Most logos are not in the public domain so do not include them even as part of an image (swoosh on clothing, brand name on a car, etc.)</p>
    <p>You are free to upload images you found to be in the Public Domain or licensed under CC0. If you do, provide source documentation such as original source and year of publication in the description field in the upload form.</p>

    <h3 class="section">File Requirements</h3>
    <p>Files must be in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg">.svg format</a>. <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a> is an open standard and can be edited & opened with many applications. We recommend <a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>.</p>
    <p>Files may NOT contain pixel images (bitmap images). If you are unsure about your image make a test: zoom in very, very, very close to any part of your image. If you start to see pixels please don't upload the image. Alternatively you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=image+trace+inkscape&page=&utm_source=opensearch">trace your image</a> converting it to an image without pixels.</p>

    <p>Crop the display area tightly around the image as shown in those images. To crop clipart in Inkscape select everything in your document, press '''Ctrl + Shift + D''', unfold "Resize page to content..." and click "Resize page to drawing or selection". But remember: certain effects like blur will increase the image size! Manually adjusting the boundary may be necessary. Add extra space around the image where appropriate.</p>
    <p>Don't signing your work or add titles as part of the graphic. This reduces the usefulness of the clip art since people will have to manually remove it. Add title and author information in the fields of the upload form.</p>
    <p>Make sure all text has been converted into paths. Not everyone has installed the fonts you used. To convert text to paths in Inkscape, select the text and hit '''Ctrl + Shift + C''' (or go to "Path" menu and chose "Object to Path").</p>
    <p>Optionally you can add metadata to your file like: licence, author, description, tags, ...</p>

    <h4>Tags:</h4>
    <p>Do keep in mind that tags are the primary way how images are found, sorted, filtered and processed; Add tags that are objective descriptions of the image content. Think about words you would use to find the image. Avoid subjective, judgmental or local descriptions. An image of an apple might be tagged like this: apple, fruit, red, food, healthy, sweet</p>
    <h4>NSWF:</h4>
    <p>Do mark your image as NSFW (Not Safe for Work) if some people might find it objectionable.</p>
