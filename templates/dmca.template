    <p>Thee Open Clip Art Library abides by the federal <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</a> by responding to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the DMCA and other applicable laws. As part of our response, we may remove or disable access to material residing on a site that is controlled or operated by the Open Clip Art Library (such as <a href="http://openclipart.org/">openclipart.org</a>) that is claimed to be infringing, in which case we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the person who submitted the affected material so that they may make a counter notification, also in accordance with the DMCA.</p>
